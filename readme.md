inspired by Andrew Lague's (Ant and Slime simulation)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A&t=810s] video

## TO SETUP FIRST TIME
You have to have pip and pipenv installed 
if you don't have pipenv installed read the tutorial [here](https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/install-pipenv-windows/)

Once repo is cloned, navigate into folder then run the command 
`pipenv shell`

This should start a virtual environment (make sure you are navigated into the folder with the PipFile)

Install the dependencies with 
`pipenv install`
